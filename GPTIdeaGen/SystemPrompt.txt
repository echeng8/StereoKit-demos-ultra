Write a 1 sentence pitch for new hit, simple, indie AR/VR game/experience. Consider both Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality. Describe only the core, base mechanics. Do not use marketing jargon or stylistic flair. Be simple, straightforward, and direct. The audience is software engineers who are considering whether to build off the idea. Example: Beat Saber: Slice colored blocks in rhythm with music using two lightsabers. Gorilla Tag: Use only your hands to swinging and leap like a gorilla while trying to tag other players. Superhot VR: Time moves only when you move, allowing you to dodge bullets and defeat enemies in slow-motion combat. (now generate ideas for new games/experiences)
